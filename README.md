# Avian Elevational Migration in the Western Ghats of India

This repository contains the code and associated files for a manuscript exploring the elevational migration strategies of birds in the Western Ghats of India. Below is a detailed breakdown of the repository's structure.

---

## Scripts

### `01_filtering_ebird_data.R`
- Cleans and filters the eBird Basic Dataset (EBD) downloaded from [eBird](https://science.ebird.org/en/use-ebird-data/download-ebird-data-products).
- Applies spatial, temporal, and sampling effort filters.
- Extracts elevation data for each occurrence record.

### `02_bias_correction_weighted_bootstrap_estimates.R`
- Corrects sampling effort biases in the filtered eBird data.
- Uses fitted GAMs and weighted resampling to equate sampling effort across seasons and elevations.

### `03_method_validation.R`
- Validates the bias correction method against published methods from [Tsai et al. (2021)](https://nsojournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecog.05196).
- Data for this script is not included in the repository but is available in the supporting information of the referenced paper.

### `04_climatic_vars_prep.R`
- Calculates speciesâ€™ tolerance to temperature, precipitation, and wind speed using occurrence records and CHELSA climate data.
- Generates tolerance estimates (2.5%, 50%, 97.5% quantiles) for these variables.
- Note: CHELSA data is not included due to size constraints but can be downloaded from [CHELSA](https://chelsa-climate.org/downloads/).

### `05_data_prep_phyloglm.R`
- Prepares climatic tolerance and species trait data along with median elevation estimates.
- Fits seasonal Phylogenetic Logistic Regression (PhyloGLM) models to analyze the effects of species traits on elevational migration status.

### `06_pgls_models_distance.R`
- Fits seasonal Phylogenetic Generalized Least Squares (PGLS) models to examine the effect of species traits on elevational migration distances.

### `07_figs.R`
- Generates the figures accompanying the manuscript.
